# Test README

This repo is only here for testing repo operations, markup, etc.

---

This is image markup from [Adam-P's Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Inline-style image link: 
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Image with reference-style link (should look exactly the same) : 
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

### Image alignment

<img src="https://github.com/TonyGravagno/Test/assets/499473/27c6179b-53e7-4fe1-ad94-a5a79ce131c6" align="left">
Some text floating to the right around the image

<br clear="left"/>

This text doesn't float anymore, follows the image, and is left-aligned.

Some text floating to the left with the image to the right.

Blah blah this text will continue to wrap on the left side of the image. Have a great day. This text is followed by a BR tag with a clear=right attribute.

<br clear="right"/>

This text doesn't float anymore, follows the image, and is left-aligned.
